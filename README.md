This repository hosts the code I compiled alongside the *hands-on* [LinkedIn Learning course](https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/nextjs-creating-and-hosting-a-full-stack-site-5952443) in learning how to use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) .

**NB:** I ran across various issue with the build & deployment stage. Thus, app isn't hosted.

## Overview

The *frontend* is built using Next.js, while its routing uses TypeScript(TS). The frontend shows a number of products in this online store, with a dynamic functionality of adding & removing items from the cart. <br>
These products/items are stored in an cloud database - MongoDB, they're then brought in the frontend via HTTP methods that form our *backend*, also written in TS.

## Limitations
The following are things not covered :
- user registration
- user authentication
- un/secure checkout.
